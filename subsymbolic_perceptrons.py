# perceptrons are modelled after neurons
# perceptions have connections to other perceptrons
# connected are inputs from ptron/s, and outputs to ptron/s. 
# each input is from another ptron firing
# each input is weighted.
# if total input exceeds a threshold, then the ptron is fired and produces an output to its connection/s
# output is yes/no 1 or 0
